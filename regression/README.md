ML.ipynb : Machine learning part of the process, first do a grid search to create Decision Trees configurations with low number of thresholds and size of training set, to get idea of accuracy quickly, then take the best configurations with a higher number of thresholds and training set to have more representative metrics.

ShowResults.ipynb : basic example on manipulating data from the ML part. Can compute different metrics about Decision Trees configurations efficiency, sort them...

ROC.ipynb : Draws ROC curves to compare regression and classification.

MSE_on_accuracy.ipynb : Displays connection between MSE and final model accuracy for regression models.
